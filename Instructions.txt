problem1(inputFileName, outputFileName, blendCo, darkCo, mode)

#inputFileName is the file name of the input file
#outputFileName is the name of the file to be saved
#blendCo is the blending coefficent between the mask and the picture
#darkCo is the darkenig coefficent
#mode is set to 1 for simple light leak and 2 for rainbow light leak
#example call: problem1("face1.jpg", "test.jpg", 21, 7, 2)


problem2(inputFileName, outputFileName, blendCo, maskSize, mode)

#inputFileName is the file name of the input file
#outputFileName is the name of the file to be saved
#blendCo is the blending coefficent between the mask and the picture
#maskSize is the size of the mask for the motion blur
#mode = 1 for greyscale and 2 for colour


problem3(inputFileName, outputFileName)

#inputFileName is the file name of the input file
#outputFileName is the name of the file to be saved 


problem4(inputFileName, outputFileName, swirlAmount, radius, mode, prefilter)

#inputFileName is the file name of the input file
#outputFileName is the name of the file to be saved 
#swirlAmount is the number of rotations
#radius is the radius of the swirl area
#mode = 1 is nearest neighbour, mode = 2 is bilineal interpolation
#prefilter = 1 is prefilter
#Example call: problem4("face1.jpg", "test4.jpg", 0.3, 200, 1, 0)
